## Welcome

I am a 3rd year PhD student in Cognitive Science at Brown Univeristy's [Laboratory of Neural Computation and Cognition](https://www.lnccbrown.com/), and I am broadly interested in computational models of human learning and decision-making. I investigate how the brain learns structure and creates useful representations in order to generalize in new contexts.  In my research, I aim to integrate multiple levels of analysis, for example by developing reinforcement learning algorithms (i.e. how to learn by trial-and-error) that draw from biological details of learning and memory.
