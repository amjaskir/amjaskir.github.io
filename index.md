## Welcome

I am a PhD candidate in Cognitive Science at Brown Univeristy's [Laboratory of Neural Computation and Cognition](https://www.lnccbrown.com/) and am interested broadly in computational models of human learning and decision-making. I investigate how the brain learns structure and creates useful representations in order to generalize in new contexts.  In my research, I aim to integrate multiple levels of analysis, for example by developing reinforcement learning algorithms (i.e. how to learn by trial-and-error) that draw from biological details of learning and memory.

I received my Bacherlor's in Computer Science and a minor in Cognitive Science from Princeton in 2017. I also completed a Fulbright Student fellowship as an English Teaching Assistant in Rivne, Ukraine.
